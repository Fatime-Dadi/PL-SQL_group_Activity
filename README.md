# PL-SQL_group_Activity

We created a comprehensive Employee Management System database with five main components: Database Schema Design,SQL Joins Implementation, Performance Optimization and Practical Queries.

# Employee Management System Database - Project Report

## üìã Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **Employee Management System** database using MySQL. The system manages employees, departments, projects, and their relationships through a well-structured relational database.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Design

### Tables Created:

<img width="668" height="398" alt="sql2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ec2718-49e4-42e3-88c6-009cb345a459" />
<img width="673" height="407" alt="sql1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/615ce677-c1e3-416e-a41c-936626a00512" />

1. **Departments** - Stores department information
2. **Employees** - Contains employee details with manager relationships
3. **Projects** - Tracks project information
4. **Employee_Projects** - Manages many-to-many relationships between employees and projects
5. **Job_History** - Maintains historical employment records

### Relationships:

- Departments to Employees (One-to-Many)
- Employees to Projects (Many-to-Many via Employee_Projects)
- Employees to Managers (Self-referencing relationship)

## üîç SQL Joins Implementation

### 1. INNER JOIN: Employees with Departments

<img width="693" height="391" alt="Inner" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec034a6d-e047-42fa-9f87-4450a7860895" />

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.dept_name, e.salary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Result:** Returns only employees who are assigned to departments, showing their department information.

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN: All Employees with Project Assignments

<img width="697" height="405" alt="Left-Join" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7772ad31-9f34-4eb9-9fee-7df91a035643" />

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, p.project_name, ep.hours_worked
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
LEFT JOIN Projects p ON ep.project_id = p.project_id;
```

**Result:** Returns all employees, including those without project assignments.

---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN: All Projects with Assigned Employees

<img width="702" height="405" alt="Right-Join" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83f9f2f1-b81e-4936-81d0-2027d44e49ba" />

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT p.project_name, e.first_name, e.last_name, ep.role, ep.hours_worked
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
RIGHT JOIN Projects p ON ep.project_id = p.project_id;
```

**Result:** Returns all projects, including those without assigned employees.

---

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN: All Employees and Projects

<img width="703" height="407" alt="Full-Join" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0391189c-be30-4a86-9684-bc204137abd1" />

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, p.project_name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
LEFT JOIN Projects p ON ep.project_id = p.project_id
UNION
SELECT e.emp_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, p.project_name
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
RIGHT JOIN Projects p ON ep.project_id = p.project_id;
```

**Result:** Returns all combinations of employees and projects, showing who is working on what.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

<img width="708" height="417" alt="sql4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec59f66b-e633-471b-87c3-c37e11c3c9c3" />

Created indexes to optimize query performance:

- `idx_employee_name` on Employees(last_name, first_name)
- `idx_employee_email` on Employees(email)
- `idx_employee_department` on Employees(dept_id)
- `idx_project_dates` on Projects(start_date, end_date)

## üëÅÔ∏è Data Accessibility Views

<img width="704" height="408" alt="sql5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cdf2bb4-290f-4fad-8338-1841002449ec" />

<img width="702" height="409" alt="sql55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8bf7de7-350b-4c2a-839f-c05c6ecc0ff1" />

Created two views for simplified data access:

1. **EmployeeDetails View**  
   Provides comprehensive employee information including department and manager details.

2. **ProjectAssignments View**  
   Shows project assignments with employee roles and hours worked.

<img width="704" height="413" alt="sql555" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f03d9f4c-aa8b-4002-8f34-bcd950c16717" />

## üìä Sample Data Insertion

Inserted sample data including:

- 5 departments with budgets
